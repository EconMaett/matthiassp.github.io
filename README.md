# Welcome to retailindex.ch!

This website was created as a one-stop-shop for everyone interested in using payment transaction data to monitoring turnover in the retail trade and services sector.

By following the instructions on this page, you should be able to reproduce and adjuste the Worldline - University of St. Gallen - Retail Trade and Services Index, or WLD-UNISG-RTSI for short.

This project was created as part of my thesis for my Master in Economics at the University of St. Gallen with a specialization in Digitization and Data Analytics.

It is an outgrowth of the project [Monitoring Consumption Switzerland](https://monitoringconsumption.com/), a joint initiative of the University of St. Gallen, the University of Lausanne–E4S, and Novalytica, supported by SIX, Worldline as well as the Swiss Payments Association.

Please note that the opinions expressed herein reflect those of the author and not necessarily those of the University of St. Gallen or of the project Monitoring Consumption Switzerland.

This is a public repository with an [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/), allowing anyone to modify and distribute this software and associated documentation files as long as the corresponding copyright notice and permission are included.

I highly encourage anyone to improve my work and I intend to update this site regularly. An interactive applicaition using [Shiny](shiny.rstudio.com/) is currently under construction and should go live by December 2021.
