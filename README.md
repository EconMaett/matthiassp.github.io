## Wellcome to retailindex.ch!

This website was created as a one-stop-shop for everyone interested in using payment transaction data to monitoring turnover in the retail trade and services sector.

By following the instructions on this page, you should be able to reproduce and adjuste the Worldline - University of St. Gallen - Retail Trade and Services Index, or WLD-UNISG-RTSI for short.

This project was created as part of my thesis for my [Master in Economics](https://www.unisg.ch/en/studium/master/volkswirtschaftslehre) at the University of St. Gallen with a specialization in Digitization and Data Analytics.

It is an outgrowth of the project [Monitoring Consumption Switzerland](https://monitoringconsumption.com/), a joint initiative of the University of St. Gallen, the University of Lausanne–E4S, and Novalytica, supported by SIX, Worldline as well as the Swiss Payments Association.

You may access this webpage over my [GitHub profile](matthiassp.github.io) or over the custom domain [www.retailindex.ch](https://www.retailindex.ch/).
